### Random Generator for Football World Cup 2022

There's a sweepstakes thing going on in the office for who is going to win the Football World Cup 2022 being hosted in Qatar. There are a number of teams and they need matching to a number of people, and the initial plan was for someone to put some cutouts of paper into two different pieces of tupperware and grab one from each until all of them are gone.

Naturally, the IT Department overheard, and now here we are. I'm automating it in Python. 

**Addendum:** I've looked at the sweepstakes thing and it seems that if statement didn't trigger, Bossman. Might be something to do w/ the fact you got Croatia, not Saudi Arabia. F in the chat for the poor soul that got that or Qatar, though.
