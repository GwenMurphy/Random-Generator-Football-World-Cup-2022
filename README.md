# Random Generator - Football World Cup 2022

There's a sweepstakes thing going on in the office for who is going to win the Football World Cup 2022 being hosted in Qater. There are a number of teams and they need matching to a number of people, and the initial plan was for someone to put some cutouts of paper into two different pieces of tupperware and grab one from each until all of them are gone.

Naturally, the IT Department overheard, and now here we are. I'm automating it in Python. Someone's misplaced the sheet with who's in the sweepstakes, so Bossman, when you see this, can you sort it? I've filled it when random stuff in the strings right now so there's 32 of them.
